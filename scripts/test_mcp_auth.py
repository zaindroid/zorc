"""test_mcp_auth.py — Phase 0 auth pipeline test. Run in CI on every PR
that touches deploy/mcp_server.py.

Proves, end-to-end over the real Streamable HTTP wire protocol against a
REAL running instance of mcp_server.py (spawned as a subprocess, never the
live production process):

  1. A valid token reaches every single registered tool (tools/list is
     used to enumerate them -- nothing here is hardcoded, so a newly added
     tool is covered automatically) and is never rejected by the auth
     layer. whoami() additionally proves identity resolves to the exact
     client that token belongs to.
  2. Two independently-minted tokens (admin + client role) resolve to
     their own distinct identities, not each other's and not a
     caller-supplied name (nothing in this test ever puts a name in a
     tool argument -- see test_no_identity_spoofing).
  3. A missing, empty, or garbage bearer token is rejected with 401 at
     the middleware, for every tool and for every JSON-RPC method
     (initialize included) -- never reaches a tool handler.
  4. A malformed mcp_token.json (bad JSON, wrong shape, bad role) makes
     the server refuse to start at all -- checked by spawning it against
     a broken file and confirming it never becomes healthy.

Entirely self-contained: spawns its own throwaway server process against
a disposable token file (ZORC_MCP_TOKEN_PATH env var override -- see
mcp_server.py), on a free local port. Never touches, reads, or restarts
the real production mcp_server.py or deploy/secrets/mcp_token.json.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/test_mcp_auth.py
Exit 0 on pass; prints the first failing assertion and exits 1 otherwise.
